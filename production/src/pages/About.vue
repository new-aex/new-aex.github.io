    <p>This project is an ongoing experiment to organise all communal efforts to connect during the corona health crisis. You can join with all kinds of content <span>(performances, skill-sharing, work-outs, video-premieres, a "welcome to my crib", exhibitions, story telling, sound art, panels, tarot readings?)</span> and platforms <span>(audio-/videostream, p2p protocol, chatroom, website, twitch-stream, skype-meeting, ?)</span> as long as it ignites inspiration, love, connection, skills, care or a radical view on online connectedness. 
    <br><br>For everyone, please donate if you can, you can find the link to the initiators' PayPal or Patreon in the description of every event. 
    </p><br>
    <p>AEX is made by Marianne Noordzij (AMS, NL) and Eurico Fernandes (AMS, NL).<br>
