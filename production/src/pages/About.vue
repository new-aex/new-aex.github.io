It's open to all kinds of content <span>(performances, skill-sharing, work-outs, video-premieres, a "welcome to my crib", exhibitions, story telling, sound art, panels, tarot readings?)</span> and platforms <span>(audio-/videostream, p2p protocol, chatroom, website, twitch-stream, skype-meeting, ?)</span> as long as it ignites love, connection, skills, care and pleasure. Please donate if you can, find the link to the initiators' PayPal or Patreon in the description.
